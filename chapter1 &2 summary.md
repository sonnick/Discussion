## CHAPTER 1- SUMMARY

An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and provides a platform for application programs to run in.
Interrupts are an important way for hardware to communicate with the operating system. A hardware device causes an interrupt by sending a signal to the CPU to notify it of an event that requires attention. The interrupt handler is in charge of managing the interrupt.

For a computer to perform its function of executing programs, the programs must be stored in main memory, which is the only large storage area that the processor has direct access to.
The main memory is typically a volatile storage device whose contents are lost when power is turned off or lost.
Non volatile storage is an extension of main memory that can store large amounts of data indefinitely.
A hard disk is the most common nonvolatile storage device, and it can store both programs and data.
The various storage systems in a computer system can be organized in a hierarchy based on speed. And the price. The higher levels are more expensive, but as we move down the hierarchy, they become faster. In general, the cost per bit decreases while access time increases.

To make the best use of the CPU, modern operating systems employ multiprogramming, which allows multiple jobs to be in memory at the same time, ensuring that the CPU is always busy.
Multitasking is a subset of multiprogramming in which the CPU scheduling algorithm switches between processes quickly in order to provide users with a quick response time.
To prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system, the system hardware has two modes: user mode and kernel mode. Several instructions are privileged and can be executed only in kernel mode.

The process is the fundamental unit of work in an operating system. The creation and deletion of processes is part of process management. I'm working on a mechanism that will allow processes to communicate and synchronize with one another.

An operating system manages memory by keeping track of which parts of memory are being used and by whom.
The operating system manages storage space, which includes providing file systems for representing files and directories and managing space on mass storage devices.
Operating systems include mechanisms for protecting and securing both the operating system and its users. Protection measures govern who has access to the resources made available by the computer system, whether it is a process or a user.

Virtualization is the process of abstracting computer hardware into multiple execution environments.
Computing takes place in a variety of environments, including traditional computers, mobile computing, client-server systems etc.

Free and open source operating systems are available in source code format. Free software is licensed to allow no cost use, redistribution and modification. Linux and Solaris are examples of popular open source systems.


## CHAPTER 2- SUMMARY

An operating system is a system program that runs on the computer to provide an interface to the computer user so that they can easily operate the computer. It basically connects user programs to hardware components in the computer. It manages all types of resources with the help of schedulers and CPU scheduling algorithms. A process encompasses the entire execution context (code to execute, data to manipulate, registers, OS resources in use). The communication between the user and device drivers is managed by the operating system.

The User Interface (UI) is the part of an operating system, program, or device that allows a user to enter and receive information. Basically, we can say that it is a space where interactions between human and machines occur. A text-based UI displays text, and its commands are usually typed on a command line using a keyboard. With a graphical interface, functions are carried out by clicking or moving buttons, icons, and menus through a pointing device.

System calls are the only entry points into the kernel system. All programs needing resources must use system calls. A system call is a way for programs to interact with an operating system. System Services: An Operating System provides services to both the users and the programs. It provides programs with an environment to execute. It gives users the services to execute the programs conveniently.

The linker is a special program that combines the object files generated by the compiler/assembler and other pieces of code to originate an executable file. Linker searches and append all libraries needed for execution of the file. A loader takes the input of object code from the linker, loads it to the main memory, and prepares this code for execution. Because they allow for separate compilation, linkers are essential in software development. 

We can decompose a huge application into smaller, more manageable modules that can be changed and compiled independently, rather than structuring it as a single monolithic source file. We just recompile one of these modules and relink the application without having to recompile the rest of the files. Linking is normally handled discreetly by the linker, and it isn't a big deal for students in basic programming classes who are developing small programs.

### QUESTIONS FROM 1 & 2:

**Q1. Why multiple core systems can be more efficient than multiple chips with single cores ?**

**Q2. Why applications are operating system specific ?If so how some of the same application are being used in multiple operating sytems?**
