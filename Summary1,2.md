## CHAPTER 1- SUMMARY

An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and provides a platform for application programs to run in.
Interrupts are an important way for hardware to communicate with the operating system. A hardware device causes an interrupt by sending a signal to the CPU to notify it of an event that requires attention. The interrupt handler is in charge of managing the interrupt.
For a computer to perform its function of executing programs, the programs must be stored in main memory, which is the only large storage area that the processor has direct access to.
The main memory is typically a volatile storage device whose contents are lost when power is turned off or lost.
Non volatile storage is an extension of main memory that can store large amounts of data indefinitely.
A hard disk is the most common nonvolatile storage device, and it can store both programs and data.
The various storage systems in a computer system can be organized in hirerachy based on speed and the price. The higher levels are more expensive, but as we move down the hierarchy, they become faster. In general, the cost per bit decreases while access time increases.
To make the best use of the CPU, modern operating systems employ multiprogramming, which allows multiple jobs to be in memory at the same time, ensuring that the CPU is always busy.
Free and open source operating systems are available in source code format. Free software is licensed to allow no cost use,redistribution and modification. Linux and Solaris are examples of popular open source systems.

## CHAPTER 2- SUMMARY
### QUESTIONS:

**Q1. Why multiple core systems can be more efficient than multiple chips with single cores ?**

**Q2. Why applications are operating system specific ?If so how some of the same application are being used in multiple operating sytems?**
